# What exactly is Brunus Labs

Brunus Labs is a software consulting firm
that takes on contracts for companies that do not
have the resources to hire their own full time
development team. We specialize in web development,
but are comfortable taking on any software challenge
presented to us. 

Brunus Labs handles everything from hosting, development
life cycle, project management, and anything else that is required.
